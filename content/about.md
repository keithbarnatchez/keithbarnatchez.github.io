Hi! I'm a biostatistics PhD student at Harvard University, advised by Rachel Nethery and Giovanni Parmigiani. My research focuses on developing methods for causal inference in observational studies when data come from various sources. 

Before grad school, I spent three years working as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston after graduating from Colby College.
