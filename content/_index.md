Hi! I'm a biostatistics PhD student at Harvard University, advised by [Rachel Nethery](https://scholar.harvard.edu/rnethery/home) and [Giovanni Parmigiani](https://scholar.harvard.edu/parmigiani). My research focuses on developing methods for causal inference when data comes from multiple sources with different sources of bias (e.g. hospital networks). 

Before grad school, I did my undergrad at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. After graduating, I spent three years working as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
