Hi! I'm a biostatistics PhD student at Harvard University, advised by [Rachel Nethery](https://scholar.harvard.edu/rnethery/home) and [Giovanni Parmigiani](https://scholar.harvard.edu/parmigiani). My research focuses on developing methods for causal inference in observational studies when data come from various sources. 

Before grad school, I spent three years working as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston after graduating from Colby College.
