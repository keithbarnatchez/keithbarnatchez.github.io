Hi! I'm a fifth-year biostatistics PhD student at Harvard University, advised by [Rachel Nethery](https://scholar.harvard.edu/rnethery/home) and [Giovanni Parmigiani](https://scholar.harvard.edu/parmigiani). My research focuses on developing methods for causal inferencewhen data is collected from multiple sources subject to different potential biases (e.g. hospital networks). My methods frequently use tools from machine learning and semiparametric theory to reduce reliance on restrictive modeling assumptions. 

I am supported by a research assistantship with the [Neurological Clinical Research Institute](https://www.massgeneral.org/ncri) (NCRI) at Massachusetts General Hospital. At the NCRI, I work with [Eric Macklin](https://biostatistics.massgeneral.org/faculty/eric-macklin-phd/) and [Marie-Abele Bind](https://biostatistics.massgeneral.org/faculty/marie-abele-bind-phd/) on developing methods for external control trials in ALS research, as well as the development of statistical criteria for assessing potential surrogate outcomes of disease progression.

Before grad school, I did my undergrad at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. After graduating, I spent three years working as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
